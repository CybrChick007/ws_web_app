User Story

Being a bowling mechanic is a demanding and at times a very fast paced job. It requires a lot of training and knowledge. But it also requires a lot of updated information and information that at times is impossible or impractical to memorize. This information also need to be accessible at a glance without a wait time.

It quickly became very clear that I could not rush into this project head on. That careful planning is required.

Interface -
The interesting thing about an interface is thinking about what other people need as apposed to what I want to do. As my user requires quick, easy viewing, using lots of flashy CSS may show my skills but have no purpose here as it would take away from the usability. This is why I have only used CSS for layout and positioning purposes and have left the visual design as simple as possible.

Clients -
For best viewing the Dashboard element of my system has been planned and designed with a big screen in mind, the idea is that it would be mounted on a wall inside the bowling tech workshop and would display all information required at one time.

the Input component has been planned and designed as a mobile application, to allow it to be portable and easy to use from anywhere on the site, so information can be updated in real time even from within the machines, from the office or front desk.

Server / API -
When originally thinking about my idea I had very grand plans for the functionality I wanted to achieve with the API, however as this is a piece of graded work I decided on completable functions. Therefore I want to design a simple server, so I decided to use a separate JS file and simply use the server to affect the functions and thus the data within this file.
      Doing this has led to data being set to a default with the system is restarted. For long term this is very undesirable but is acceptable for this prototype.

<!--To do:
  Server/API -

    Collect information on submit
    parse to JSON
    check if the data is different than existing information
    display in appropriate location on dashboard

  front end -

-->
